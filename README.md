# Startup-Health-Scoring-Model

# Description
      -This Jupyter Notebook analyzes a startup performance dataset by preprocessing key business metrics, calculating custom scores using weighted normalization, clustering startups using KMeans, and finally   applying Linear Regression to predict scores based on business metrics. The goal is to segment startups and understand what drives their success.

# Assignment Context
This notebook was submitted as part of a Machine Learning internship screening assignment. The goal was to analyze a startup dataset and demonstrate practical skills in data analysis and machine learning.

The task involved cleaning and preprocessing the data, normalizing key performance indicators, designing a custom scoring logic using weighted metrics, and applying KMeans Clustering to group similar startups. In the final step, a Linear Regression model was trained to predict the final startup scores based on the normalized features, and the model performance was evaluated using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
